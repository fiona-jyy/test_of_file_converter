      it can be difficult to make decisions and prepare for the next weeks or months.
      To be transparent with our students and staff, we summarise in this document
      all the <strong>safety measures Le Wagon has put in place, the situation in
      each of our campuses and the adaptations we have made to our programs to optimise
      remote learning</strong> when necessary and provide the best education experience
      as well as the safest environment for our students, teachers and staff.
    main_intro_part_two: All Le Wagon teams are ready to face this unprecedented challenge
      and extremely motivated to help our students make the most out of this period,
      acquire strong technical skills and achieve their objectives after their bootcamp.

          to report to the campus manager and stay home for a minimum 14-day period
          of self-quarantine. There are arrangements in place such that anyone affected
          can follow the courses, stay in contact with and ask our teaching staff
          questions using Slack video calls, to ensure their learning experience is
          not affected."

          into contact with people with who display symptoms of COVID-19 to alert
          this to the campus manager so that we can take necessary actions. Students
          or staff who have recently travelled or plan to travel to any country or
          region outside of the city of their campus also have to inform our team,
          monitor their symptoms closely and to follow a 14 day period of self-quarantine

        below we give you a taste of what it will look like:'
      full_time:
        alert: By coding and working remotely like a lot of developers in the real
          world (in companies with remote policies or as a freelance developer), you
          will learn how to adapt and develop your collaboration skills much faster.
          All this with the same support from our teachers and teaching assistants
          and the same interactions with your classmates as in our on-campus course.
        coding_challenges:
          text_part_one: After the lecture, you'll work on programming challenges
            as you would do in our on-campus course. For that, you will have the same
            help from our teachers and teaching assistants as on on-campus. Teacher
            and teaching assistants will be ready to provide 1:1 support via video
            calls on Slack where they will help you solve your problems whenever you
            are stuck. Below is an example of how you will post a question (we call
            it a ticket) on our platform and receive a swift answer from a teacher
            to start via a video call.
          text_part_two: In addition, you will team up every day with a new classmate
            (called your "buddy") and you will help each other using Slack instant
            messaging. Right after the lecture, you'll launch a slack call to go through
            the instruction of each challenge and discuss them with your buddy. Then,
            you'll just leave this call opened throughout the day (in mute) and you'll
            be able to unmute and discuss with your buddy at any time (even sharing
            your screen), exactly like you would do in a real classroom with your
            buddy right next to you.

            <strong>9:00 a.m.</strong> on Zoom (or using Slack Call if the class has
            less than 15 students). All students will join <strong>on time</strong>
            and will be able to ask questions at any time during the lecture. All
            the lectures are recorded and will be available on Le Wagon's learning
            platform so that students will be able to catch up if they miss a lecture
            during the weekend."

        title: Full-Time Remote
      intro_part_one: We have made all the necessary adaptations to provide a hybrid
        or totally remote bootcamp in all the Le Wagon cities where necessary. We
        have the resources and tools to temporarily switch to remote learning and
        ensure an engaging experience for our students.
      intro_part_three: This is a temporary measure and will be in place until the
        COVID-19 outbreak gets resolved. If things are resolved sooner, we will ask
        students to come back to campus to finish their course.
      intro_part_two: In such a case, students will have remote lectures and live-codes
        using a live video call (with Slack or Zoom) and they will be able to ask
        questions when they feel stuck on any of their exercises throughout the day
        as well as get real-time help from teachers and teaching assistants - exactly
        as they would during an on-campus bootcamp.
      part_time:
        intro: As a part-time student, you will have remote sessions with the same
          schedule as initially planned for on-campus bootcamps, meaning on Tuesday
          evening, Thursday evening and Saturday during the day.
        list:
          item_four_html: "<strong>Lectures and flashcards:</strong> Of course, we
            will expect you to prepare every remote session by watching the lecture
            of the day and doing your flashcards beforehand, as you would do for the
            on-campus course."
          item_one_html: "<strong>Coding challenges:</strong> during every session
            (evenings and Saturday), you'll work on our coding challenges. For that,
            you will have the same help from our teachers and teaching assistants
            as you would in the on-campus course and they will be ready to provide
            1:1 support via slack calls at any time to help you solve your problems
            whenever you are feel stuck (exactly as described in the section above
            about coding challenges for full-time students)."
          item_three_html: "<strong>Live-corrections:</strong> Twice a week, you will
            have live corrections of some important coding challenges during a Zoom
            meeting where the teacher will go through all the steps to solve an exercise
            with all the class, answering all of your questions."
          item_two_html: <strong>Buddy:</strong> like full-time students, you will
            also team up with different classmates and work on the exercises together
            via Slack instant messaging to help each other (exactly as described in
            the section above about "buddy system" for full-time students).
        title: Part-time Remote
      temporary:
        alert: All Le Wagon's staff, teachers, teaching assistants, partners and tech
          communities around the world are prepared and very determined to face the
          challenge ahead. We will help each of our students to emerge from this troubled
          period, not only with strong technical skills, but also with a unique ability
          to adapt and to collaborate with each others, which we are sure will be
          very useful for their future career as developers or freelancers.
        intro: We have adapted our bootcamps to make the most out of remote work as
          a temporary solution for cities that cannot operate on-campus bootcamps.
          Obviously, our hope is to be able to welcome students on-campus again as
          soon as the situation improves and local authorities allow us to do so.

      intro: In every city, we are closely monitoring the status of the outbreak and
        strictly applying recommendations from the World Health Organisation, governments
        and public health authorities.
      list:
        intro: 'Each of our cities is in a different situation:'
        item_one_html: Some cities can operate on-campus, keeping their next batch
          at the start date initially planned, and applying very strict safety measures
          as described below in <strong>Safety measure and policies</strong>.
        item_three_html: Finally, some of our cities have already started running
          their bootcamps remotely with all the tools, resources and support from
          our teachers to engage our students and ensure they make the most out of
          their bootcamp while locked at home. Our remote adaptations are detailed
          below in the section <strong>Remote bootcamp</strong> giving you more details
          on what a remote experience looks like for our students. Some of these cities
          might have to start their next bootcamps remotely if lockdown periods are
          maintained or extended.
        item_two: Other cities might have to postpone their upcoming bootcamps by
          a few weeks, depending on the decisions of their local authorities (lockdown
          period, closed borders).

      follow_path_content_1: After university, many people feel like they're missing
        the necessary skills to do something meaningful and exciting in their professional
        life. If you want to learn practical and technical skills that will enable
        you to quickly create your projects from scratch, or join a tech startup as
        a developer, product manager or growth marketer, our coding bootcamps are
        the perfect education experience.
      follow_path_content_2: You might have been working in the same industry or job
        for a few years, and feel a little unsatisfied. If you are looking for more
        technical autonomy, freedom and drive, coding is definitely a tool that will
        help you get there - either to launch your own company, become a full-time
        or freelance developer, or develop technical projects in your current job.
      follow_path_content_3: if you're working in tech but are not familiar with coding,
        you probably feel a bit frustrated when talking to developers. If you want
        to gain legitimacy and technicity to upskill, or simply communicate better
        with your dev team, a coding bootcamp is exactly what you need. If you want
        to launch your startup, you will learn to prototype your MVP, be autonomous
        on small technical tasks, and manage your future dev team.
      follow_path_description: Whether you want to communicate better with developers,
        drastically change your career path or complete your education, a coding bootcamp
        is probably the right choice.

        their own startup, or add a technical know-how to their skillset.
      paragraph_2_html: Our coding bootcamp teaches you all the web stack, from the
        database to the browser. You will learn the core concepts of object-oriented
        programming, and structure your software following design patterns like MVC.
        In addition to mastering back-end programming languages (Ruby, SQL), you will
        develop your front-end skills using recent techniques like flexbox, CSS grid
        and learn ES6, the latest version of JavaScript.
      paragraph_3_html: 'We strongly believe that there is a good way of building
        web products. During our bootcamp, we teach you how successful startups work:
        design your project''s wireframe & mockup, test your UX with a prototype,
        split your user stories across your team and collaborate with branch and pull
        requests with git and Github.'
      paragraph_4_html: We also teach you how to learn, and what tools to use to do
        so (Heroku, Stripe, MailChimp, Cloudinary, Algolia…) You learn how to implement
        all these services to be more efficient when you launch your product.
      paragraph_5_html: At the end of the bootcamp, you will be able to build a web
        product from scratch, design a relational database and build queries with
        SQL, integrate a 3rd service using an API or scrape HTML data, and be able
        to learn a new programming language very quickly, which is extremely important
        in the fast-paced environment of web development.
      pros_content_1: Since 2013, we have constantly been improving our curriculum
        and tools to match our students' needs, getting rid of every friction in the
        process of learning to code. Our in-house trained teachers adapt to every
        student's pace and level, making sure that nobody's left behind. As a result,
        Le Wagon has been featured as n°1 world coding bootcamp on ranking websites
        for several years
      pros_content_2: After the bootcamp, a new life starts. Our alumni keep a lifetime
        access to our online learning platform, with up-to-date videos and tutorials
        about the latest tools and best practices of software development. But most
        importantly, they belong to a community and network of people who help each
        other, using our internal chat and alumni database to share tips and opportunities.
      pros_content_3: Le Wagon is a product-driven bootcamp. During the course, our
        students learn how to build robust and beautiful web applications by themselves,
        from the back-end all the way to the front-end. But they also learn to collaborate
        within a team of developers and adopt the technical workflow followed by most
        successful startups. Le Wagon teaches you how to create a product, but it
        also teaches you how to think and solve problems like a developer.
      pros_title_1: Committed to excellence
      pros_title_2: An international community

    software_foundations:
      content_1: Work with the right developer tools and workflow. Learn the basics
        of the command line, use a code text editor and install Ruby with a version
        management tool. Get familiar with most useful developer packages and learn
        how to version your code with git and push it on Github.
      content_2: Write programs manipulating variables, loops, conditions and data
        structures (Array and Hash). Detect text patterns with Regular Expressions
        and start parsing data from structured files (CSV, JSON, XML, HTML) fetched
        using web-scraping or by building requests to JSON APIs.
      content_3: Structure your software following Object-Oriented principles. Learn
        the Model-View-Controller pattern in-depth (most common application design
        pattern) by coding several MVC softwares from scratch. You will have to code
        everything on your own, even simulating your database storing data in CSV
        files.
      content_4: Learn to design a relational database schema and to build structured
        queries to your database with SQL. Build simple CRUD queries (Create, Read,
        Update, Delete) or advanced JOIN queries. Learn to connect your database to
        your ruby software with an ORM (Object Relational Mapping) called Active Record.

    web_development:
      content_1: Build your web pages following atomic design principles and code
        your own UI kit of web components & layouts by applying the latest CSS techniques.
        Build pages with an adaptive design thanks to media queries and learn to quickly
        prototype a web app with Bootstrap 4.0 and its responsive grid system.
      content_2: Learn ES6, your second programming language after ruby, to add dynamic
        behaviors to your website or update pages without reloading thanks to AJAX.
        Understand JavaScript fundamental concepts and learn to use all the necessary
        JS web tools like Babel, Webpack or yarn.
      content_3: Wrap it all together by coding your first Ruby on Rails applications.
        Deploy your applications in production & start coding "the Rails way". Go
